# RubikStopTap

The best application to measure your time solving the Magic Cube, just select the size of your cube, Scramble your cube, shake your Pebble to start review time, when Pebble vibes start solving, when done shake your Pebble to stop the timer and Check your time, shake your Pebble to register your time and reset the timer. Now your Pebble is ready to start again and again.

Keep track of your stats like average, best and worst times for each cube size independently and compare it with your friends.

Happy solving!!
